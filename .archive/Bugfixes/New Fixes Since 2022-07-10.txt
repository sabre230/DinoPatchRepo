DF WHIRLPOOL PUZZLE FIX:

Here's the code for that if you'd like to test it out!
It might be possible to adjust the radius of the detection too
 - I'll ask Jeebs if he has any ideas about how to do that :3

0x20FAA42: C4FB623043E08000C4CE8000

This should also make it so the switch at the bottom of the pool can only be activated after the wall is destroyed: 
0x20FAA34: 0105




SMALL FIXES:

Couple of wee ones. Collecting the BWC Spellstone will now show it's proper name in the cutscene pickup (default said "Alpine Root")

GP - DFP Portal door. Upon returning for the 2nd visit the collision behind the portal door will return, 
essentially blocking you off in on a cheatless run. This will remove the HITS collision from it entirely 
until I can figure out how to remove only once the Portal spell is used

A few Test of Knowledge ones. The Flybaddies in there will now no longer spawn those annoying Sabre clones that normally crash the game lol

03A293FA 0002




OPTIONAL: Change Test of Knowledge music to version used in SFA. First half is the the original, 2nd is updated

Fixing percentage up to Tricky's Rescue, feel free to have a go at fixing more. It's a bit too tedious for me: 

37DEC82: 011DA004
37DEC36: 011BA005
37DEB1A: 00FBA006
37DEB26: 00FEA007
37DF74E: 010CA008

Oh, and thanks to Jeebs for the head-start how the percent meter gets its number.

Test of Fear to MMP, to Warlock Mountain fixes

These will allow to you to warp back to MMP after it's test, 
play the "find 6 spirits" cutscene and warp to the proper Warlock Mountain state from the Swapstone! 

Hasn't been tested in a full run but "should" be good, though any issues as ever let me know!

0216D82C 4900 - Test of Fear warp to MMP upon completion (Be sure to use the MMP Transporter first instead of warping directly to ToF!)

03A22A96 0004 - Beating ToF will set flag to be able to drop 3rd spirit when WM is reached

03A22A92 0489 - Beating Tof will change flag to trigger this + above

03A42492 0000 - Swapstone doesnt force increase value when warping (this and below codes, Swapstone normally forces WM 1 everytime)

03A42490 0000
0216D1F2 0112
0216D1F4 421C - this and above, add flag to ToF to trigger triggerplane in MMP

From 0213CC5E , paste - C4C7A35844730000C5783858 (moves sideload to Transporter so Krazoza doesn't show up early!) 






This stops particles from disabling themselves after collecting cloudrunner food

03A1B712 0095






Added some warp coordinates to get you back to Walled City after completing it's test!

From 020E067A , paste - C5FA0739C3EF8000C5E60C54

0216E37C 4400
03A4242C 0000
03A4242E 0000 - This and above to stop Rocky from forcing WM2 everytime
