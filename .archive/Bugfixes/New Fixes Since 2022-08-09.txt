The sandworm boss crashes when you save and reload the game in that location. The cause? Kyte's spawn point doesn't fire off the moment the boss loads. Its load distance is too small. This will fix that.

Rolling Demo - Krystal Logfix

Changing some MAPS objects and their OBJSEQ counterparts, this will get Krystal back on the log in the game's opening! Not perfect, but definitely better than before!

Desert Force Point 3 Fixes!

All these will allow you to get through the last DFPT visit and connect to back to Golden Plains. As doing things a bit out of order, keep in mind you'll only be able to visit the 3rd state while holding the KP Spellstone. This will be part of a CC3/KP fix when I get there. For testing you can give yourself the stone with - 805C4DAC 0010

There's still some tweaks needed like:

Look into the issue with the "all instruments" DFP music trigger

Set WGmutant to talk only when 3rd spellstone is placed

Fix and add subtitles to spell place scene

Set state for GP3 - including the bike chase sequence of events

Likely some other things









DFP3 subtitles patched back in - Timing isn't perfect but does the job!

01F6497E A203 - This and above add text trigger for subs to scene

Subs timing - feel free to edit to match up better, adding colour to text etc

Quick patch to get Kyte from SC/LFV to Blackwater Canyon!

She normally gets stuck in the totem puzzle room and will eventully crash the game when too far. 
This will unload her and will spawn her back when in the central BWC section. 
Ideally, there may be a way to connect the 2 curves from SC-BWC (Her first BWC curves under group 8A I think!) 

Can delete this post once a better patch is made but should do for now at least!
