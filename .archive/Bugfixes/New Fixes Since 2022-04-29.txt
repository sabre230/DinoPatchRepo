Diamond Bay River Falling Rocks Crash Fix Corrected:
02172826 000E


Discovery Falls Music Triggerplane Moved:

Looking at the DF music Triggerplane. 
It turns out it's actually the correct way around, 
but for some reason moving quickly through it after 
the tunnel can sometimes skip the music. I've moved 
this to just before you reach the first waterfall, 
should play in most cases now if this can be tested -

0212C18E FFFF - Transporter (Duster) No longer requires a flag to activate
01EEAA22 0814 - WM 3 Cutscene opens Moon door in WC (Need to remove previous WM code)
0212E63C 0815 - Inside moon temple: Main room open Sun Generaldoor

Fix Sun inside door from closing behind you (even if already in mid animation) No Dusters were harmed..........Triggerplane to the rescue!

Adding a music trigger on your way to the mine in DIM drastically decreases your chances of getting a sound crash on your speeder. This inserts the race theme just outside the speeder door. Feel free to make a more polished version that plays it sooner if you want.

For Dinomod 2.4:
214394A: 01030044
214394E: 0103001A

Alright, here's the new speeder patch for DIM.  
Address: Value
37E9E16: 0x9000FFFE - Cutscene object swap
37E9E1E: 0xD100030F - Cutscene object swap
37E9E26: 0xD0000000 - Cutscene object swap
37E9E2E: 0xD0000072 - Cutscene object swap
37E9E36: 0x0000FFFF - Cutscene object swap
21442EE: 0x0A130006 - Loads snowballs and door in the speeder's cave
21442F2: 0x05140006 - Unloads snowballs and door (EDIT, this was wrong)
214488A: 0x05140006 - Unloads snowballs and door by the mine entry


Here's this one too, if you want it.
Address: Value
21446C6: 0512442B - Ramping into mine cutscene trigger

EDIT: Needed this too...
21446F2: 042D - Ramp Cutscene Condition: On Snowbike







This should allow you to progress through WM 3, playing the "How is Fox?" cutscene that will spawn in the rising platform. Flag check for that scene disabled

02116DB6 FFFF

And this will get Randorn to show up in that same cutscene - downside is there will be 2 Randorns briefly during the Skeetla scene, but worth the trade I think

021169B0 82BD 

Optional: This will add in subtitles to the Skeetla scene - doesn't overwrite anything of importance

01EEAC7C 0D05
01EEAC7E A039





Here's something for the time being, can refine later with better placement, what it's looking for etc.
Going through Moon side doors in Walled City will change map setup to 2 (The key one that will put all the other WC2 stuff together)

0212BB12 0518
0212BB14 0002

You won't need to freeze 5C4DD5 12 for testing now. should work in an actual run now


Garunda Te's spellstone setup fix... Moved a TriggerPlane a little further back. 
Address: Value
210F712: 453E77AE




ROM:
Add map level 2 setup to "Sun side" WC2
0212BB62 0518
0212BB64 0002

Just like the moon one, these are using empty spaces





Meant to post this way sooner. Minor patch... 
Nuggs's Galadon void patch was flawed. 
If you walked in and out of the mine, you'd get put into the void, 
or get stuck in a non loading state of DIM, unlike in Vanilla. 
This fixes that.

Address: Value

2144874: F3 - Lower TriggerPlane to stop Post-Galadon void glitch

38E1E14: 00000000 - Disable Dinomod's flawed DIM void spawn patch

Now hopefully the TriggerPlane isn't TOO low as to stop the mine from loading... lol

I did test a few times without any problems, but you never know if there's a special case where it won't.


This one was accidentally made when demonstrating the map editor with bizhawk. 
Adjusting the DIM bridge again. 

Address: Value

2145E4A: 0xC4A54B80

Not too bad looking. Slight clipping, but that's as high as I can reliably get Sabre to step off the bridge.



This is a better spirit placement for WM 3 - 
the previous one, the scene could play again if you stepped in the same spot. 
This should fix that:

ROM:
021190EF 03 - change seqtype

Also you can remove the previous code that moved the Sequence point, 
this one:
" Move 3rd spirit to stop looping (moves WL_Seqpoint a few steps)
021190DE 4452 "


^^^^ 
This should now default to 021190DE 444B for that




Warlock Mountain 4 Fixes:

This should do the job but if anyone would like to refine 
feel free to change anything! 

ROM:
021174A0 09EF - Spiritset obj in correct state
021173BA FFFF - Bypass trigger check 1
0211742E FFFF - Bypass trigger check 2
021174E2 FFFF - Bypass trigger check 3
021174DB 03 - Seq setup change
02117F52 C3A5 - WL fallen column moved down
0211742C 08A1 - Added flag to activate WM teleporter

SHOPKEEPER SMALL FOOD BAG FOR SABRE IMPROVED

Oh and a better small bag for the shop one + doesn't affect Shopkeeper!

ROM:
0211ACF6 0112
0211ACF8 448A
(Triggers in WM 1 on way back from speaking to Randorn, empty spaces used for this. Works good!)

Related, but you'll want to keep these 2 in. The visual of the item bags
038171F0 021D
038171F4 021C

I'll undo this one:
03AFBA52 048A (flag)

For Dinopatch 2.4:
03AF52E2 048A (flag)

For dinosdk_example_v1:
03AF547A 048A (flag)



Walled City Teleporter Adjusted:

So old Duster to WC Transporter was - 
0212C16E 00EC
0212C176 4470
0212C17A C3EE
0212C17E C595
0212C188 2800 

New one would be - 
0212C16E 00EC
0212C176 446F
0212C178 D220
0212C17C 715E

0212C17E C595
0212C180 E1DD

Remove Sun Temple Laser Bar: (DEPRECATED DON'T USE)

Here you go - even managed to test it quickly and does rid of it - 
ROM
0212DA4A 000E

Fix Sun Temple Laser Bar: (DEPRECATED DON'T USE)

Oh yeah for that video was just a basic obj switchover - 
0212DA4A 0142


Fix Sun Temple Laser Bar: (THIS WORKS BETTER)

Small one - Fix sun laser in WC 2. 
Should be good - 

ROM:
0212DA62 0002
0212DA64 00B4
0212DA66 00B4
0212DA68 0095

0212DA6A FFFF
0212DA6C 0000



WC Sun symbol shows without needing to exit area:

ROM:
0212D646 00E7

This is just telling it, if this flag has played, show the symbol. 
00E7 is always active from the start!



This will stop the LFV Musclefoot trial from going to a black screen. You can see what you're doing now lol. Also the following cutscene won't black out now 

ROM:
01F298D8 0000
01F298DA 0000

And this will open up the gates to BWC upon approaching. Have the flagchecker at FFFF but this can be changed - 

ROM:
02133502 FFFF




This will restore the "Riding the Snowhorn" music, 
and revert back to the regular track upon dismounting the Snowhorn. 
Haven't tested but should work for both time's you're on it as 
it's sequence based changes - 

ROM:
01ED1200 0D11
01ED1202 0132 - this and above is for music when mounting

01ED0E9C 0D11
01ED0E9E 005F - and these 2 for dismounting to play the DIM music

Track ID 0133 change: 
past this into 
01E6D22C
0233 7F00 000F FFFF FFFF















Enable Unused Cape Claw Fortress Beacons:

Indexed just after the "CCperchSwitch" object model is this Cape Claw themed version of the beacons that are revealed after solving the area's Krazoa symbol lever puzzle. The beacon model from Swapstone Circle was reused as a placeholder, but it seems they never got around to updating it after this model was created. Kyte can still interact with it correctly after replacement, however the beacon's model does float very slightly above the ground.

To patch the model into place, 
change the two bytes at address 382405C from 00D7 to 0147.



DONT USE THIS FOR BUGFIX PATCH - ONLY FOR NEMU64:

For those stuck up (like me) using Nemu to debug things. 
38E1E95 E0 stops Dinomod 2.4 from crashing every time you walk on a new map block. 
I have no idea what it disables, but it's disabling some patch after Dinomod 2.3. 





INSERT UNUSED SONG SPARSE1F TO CAPE CLAW FORTRESS (DONT USE FOR BUGFIX PATCH):

You can copy these values, 02 1F 41 00 00 0F FF FF FF FF and press CTRL+B 
at address 1E6D22C in HxD to insert the track into ID 0x133

I just realized I set the volume too low. Set 41 to 7F... I copied and pasted from a quiet version of GuardClaw. lol 







Here are Some Notes on Walled City 2nd Visit Restoration:
- Sun Side Temple switch removes the entire wall. And the wall is see-through.
- Can the sun side elevator be deactivated after getting the sun stone?
(Elevator takes you up when you try to leave the temple. Minor gripe, I know)
