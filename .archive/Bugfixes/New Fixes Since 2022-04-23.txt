SWAPSTONE HOLLOW LEAVES FIX:

LeavesTex_234C85E_comp.bin

If you select/copy all the bytes in this file and do CTRL+B at address offset: 
0x0234C85E in ROM, the leaves should be patched.



SMALL FIXES
On the topic of patches... I quietly patched really small ones... 
In 1EF0A33, I set it to zero to get rid of the... "Beware of he mines" text after you defeat Galadon, 
and set 0x39F6AD0 to "24 07 FF FF" (Which replaces 3C 07 00 01), 
to get rid of a memory corrupting flag in Cloudrunner Fortress after you pick up the chest key.


Remove "Beware of the mines" text after Galadon fight:
01EF0A33 --> 00

WARLOCK MOUNTAIN 3 FIX

Hey awesome! Just about to head off but should be back late tomorrow or Monday. 
I'd remove all of those except for the Randorn cutscene one! 
All the one's above are a WiP for later
Oh wait and the FFFF one, keep that lol

Something like this - 

Sideload fix to play skeetla cutscene on time
02119A02 43A4
02119A06 C2C4
02119A0A 4491

WM 3 SPIRIT PLACE
021190F6 FFFF

Move 3rd spirit to stop looping (moves WL_Seqpoint a few steps)
021190DE 4452

WM 3 cutscene opens sun doors in WC
01EEAA22 0815

Those last 2 should be fine but ran out of time for full testing for now!
Maybe did like 3 or 4 goes, but not a full run
