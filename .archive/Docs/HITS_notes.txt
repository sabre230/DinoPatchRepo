Here are some notes on how HITS.bin works, just in case it's helpful for editing more of the game's collision setups!

HITS.tab divides HITS.bin into 1103 ranges, one for each of the 1103 BLOCKS models in the game. Each BLOCKS model's HITS file contains data for a collection of lines in 3D space.

Each collision line uses 20 bytes of data. This contains signed 2-byte XYZ coordinates for Point A and Point B of the line (taken relative to the BLOCK model's local origin), the type of collision (jump point, ledge grab point, vine/rock-climbing point, pushblock bounds, enemy bounds, etc.) and its settings and height values. Each BLOCK's HITS file is padded with zeros at the end so that its total length is a multiple of 8.

Collision lines generally seem to only take effect when Krystal/Sabre/baddies/etc approach it from one side, for example when Krystal/Sabre cross a jump collision line Point A needs to be on their right and Point B on their left.

Depending on their settings some collision types (like ledge grabs and vines) can use two 1-byte height values instead of just one 2-byte height value. In this case, the values describe separate heights above Point A and Point B. This is used when grabbing a sloped ledge, for example.

Here are a few example settings (bytes 0xC to 0xF of a collision line):

0058 8083 - vine/rock climb, height 0x58 (88), can let go at base
0043 8E03 - vine/rock climb, height 0x43 (67), can't let go at base
00AD 8803 - vine/rock climb, height 0xAD (173), can let go at base, can't climb over top
3F46 0083 - vine/rock climb, variable height 0x3F (63, above A) 0x46 (70, above B), can let go at base

2828 0E84 - jump point, can't dangle at edge
2828 0E85 - ledge you can dangle from, or take a running jump
2828 0082 - ledge you can dangle from, but can't jump off
2828 0E80 - ledge you can't dangle from, or take a running jump
2828 0C01 - ledge you can't pass

0018 8E86 - ledge climb-up, height 0x18 (24)
1618 0E86 - ledge climb-up, variable height 0x16 (22, above A) 0x18 (24, above B)

0028 0E90 - clamber onto ledge while swimming, height 0x28 (40)

0038 0001 - invisible wall, height 0x38 (56)

2828 070D - pushblock bounds

2828 0701 - log dismount possible?

2828 0B01 - enemy bounds?


COLLISION LINE BYTES
====================

Coordinates for points A and B
(Signed integers, relative to BLOCKS model's local origin)
0x0 to 0x1: Ax
0x2 to 0x3: Bx
0x4 to 0x5: Ay
0x6 to 0x7: By
0x8 to 0x9: Az
0xA to 0xB: Bz

0xC to 0xD: height(s) (2-byte integer, or depending on settings can also be two 1-byte integers)
0xE to 0xF: collision type and settings
0x10 to 0x11: unknown, "FFFF" seems to be the default value but it's occasionally something else... possibly collision group?
0x12 to 0x13: unknown
