For RAM ID's there's the object wiki page (I still need to update the visuals on the latter half!)

In ROM There's MusicalProgrammers list called "DPObjects2.txt", that's been really helpful with cutscene objects for this and SFA Kiosk. Then there's the object visual in ROM which is here :

^^^ That one was put up over a year ago but still helpul getting a general idea of what is what!







The object visual is usually around here after each entry (Or after all the FFFF's as a good indicator lol) some have more than one entry, like differen states - eg. WC Sun and Moon pads change after stepping on them
