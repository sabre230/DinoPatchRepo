------------------------------

Why did I make two Patches?

By default the game uses less detailed models when you control your character.
Higher quality models are used during cutscenes only.

The HQ models patch makes these cutscene quality models playable.
It causes a few harmless visual glitches, for example Krystal's spirit eyes are misaligned.
Performance also takes a hit with this patch, don't use it if you play on real N64 hardware.

Both patches include the exact same bugfixes, you only have to apply one of them.

------------------------------

Story Progression Order:

Krystal:

There's more content at Cape Claw 2, Willow Grove, Golden Plains 2, Dragon Rock and Krazoa Palace,
but those areas haven't been restored yet and are currently broken.

------------------------------

Avoiding Out of Memory Crashes:

It makes sense to rely on emulator savestates when you reach new areas to avoid getting stuck.

But you should properly Save and Reload your game when you use the Swapstone between levels.
Whenever your quest leads you to the Swapstone stand on the Swapstone Platform and Save+Reload.

This cleans up the game's memory and greatly reduces the risk of getting "Fault at Thread 3" 
out of memory crashes.

Standing on the Swapstone Platform guarantees the game writes your inventory into the save file. 
So you won't lose any items, sidekick commands or spells.

Don't save the game in places other than the Swapstone Platform as this can break puzzles
and story progression.

------------------------------

Pressure Switch Crashes:

The pressure pad switches in Darkice Mines and Walled City crash the game in Project64.

For Darkice Mines a workaround is to shoot the switch itself instead of the rock.
That activates it reliably without crashing.

For Walled City try to walk over the edge of the Sun/Moon switch, just enough to activate it.
Keep holding forward and don't stand on the switch for more than a few seconds to avoid the crash.

In Mupen64 the pressure switches work without crashing.

------------------------------

Defeating Klanadack:

One trick is to always stay behind him. 
After you land a hit on him intentionally let yourself get run over.
Don't try to run away from him as that seems to trigger his glitched state.

You may have to enable Infinite Health for this method:

Infinite Health
805C3971 007C
805C3965 007C

There is a cheat that is supposed to prevent him from glitching into the walls:

Klanadack Bugfix
810DA130 0705

Another thing you can try is fast game speed:

Fast Game Speed (Fixes Klanadack)
8005DA87 0003

Game Speed Back to Normal (After Klanadack)
8005DA87 0001

If you are playing on Mupen64 you can also set the game speed to "Original" instead of "Fullspeed".

That should help. His glitching is tied to the framerate. 
On real hardware he works more reliably because the game is losing frames.

I was able to beat Klanadack by setting the game speed in Mupen to "Original".
After beating him you can set Mupen back to "Fullspeed".

------------------------------

Walled City Sun Push Block Puzzle:

On Mupen64 this puzzle works fine, on Project64 it crashes the game.

Use this Gameshark code to prevent the crash on PJ64:

Walled City Sun Block Puzzle Crash Fix
81059DD4 0000
81059DE0 0000

The game is more likely to crash with Project64 in general.
It is recommended to play Dinosaur Planet with Mupen64 unless you have no other choice.

------------------------------

Garunda Te's Twelve Frostweeds:

Many people feel that gathering 12 weeds is tedious and too much for this task.
We decided not to decrease the number since the audio line mentions 12.

If you want to make this task a bit easier, here's a Gameshark code:

Garunda Te Only Needs 4 Frost Weeds
D05C4C3E 0060
805C4C3E 0061

My guess is that Tricky's Distract command was planned to help you guide the weeds.
It's in an unfinished state though and currently doesn't help much at all.

------------------------------

Unable to use C-Buttons in Warlock Mountain:

Sometimes when you return to Warlock Mountain to deposit a Spirit your C-Buttons won't work.
You can't use items, spells etc.

To fix this simply pause and unpause the game.

------------------------------

Quick-Unlock Kyte for Testing:

If you quickly need to have Kyte with you use "Warp to location" from the Dinomod menu.
From this menu warp to "Cape Claw - Beach".

Walk over that dark circular patch of ground on the beach.

Kyte will automatically be enabled when you do this.
It has the same effect as unlocking her cell in the Cape Claw Fortress.

------------------------------

Exploring the Rolling Demo Map:

This map is locked into the demo cutscene when you warp there.
A cheat disables the cutscene sequence and allows you explore the map.

Playable Rolling Demo
81253534 0000

------------------------------

Enable Old Item Pickup Jingle:

Press D-Pad Right to open the Dinomod menu. In the menu scroll down to "Settings".

There you can "Enable old pickup jingle".
This is the sound effect that plays when you collect an item.

The old item jingle sounds much better in my opinion, it might be worth enabling this option.

------------------------------

Disable Anti-Aliasing:

In the Dinomod "Settings" menu you can "Disable anti-aliasing".
Doing so improves performance ever so slighty and gives the game a sharper look.

Changed settings in this menu will be saved and retained next time you boot up the game.

------------------------------

Enable Fox McCloud:

The option "Enable Fox model" in the Dinomod "Settings" menu allows you to play as Fox at any time.
We felt it was a nice way of keeping both characters playable without the need of two different patches.

In regular gameplay Fox has become Sabre's Illusion Spell model.
Sabre originally did not have a unique model for the spell unlike Krystal.

------------------------------

Don't "Disable patches":

This setting should be left alone.
It disables essential patches that fix game breaking bugs.

------------------------------

Don't Play with Dinomod Cheats Enabled:

You can "Enable cheats" in the Dinomod menu to get all spells, sidekick commands and full health/magic.
But don't keep them enabled! This can break things and cause crashes.

Enable cheats to get all the stuff and immediately turn them off again and you should be fine.

------------------------------

Turn Off the Minimap:

On the Dinosaur Planet title screen select "Options" and then "Display".
There you can set "Instruments" to OFF.

Don't ask me why this option is called that, but doing so disables the Minimap.
It's perfect for taking screenshots and makes the game look even more gorgeous.

------------------------------

Skip the Splash Screens:

When you load up the game you'll see the Dolby Surround text and then the splash screens
with the Rareware and Nintendo 64 logos before you get to the DP title screen.

Press D-Pad Left to skip all splash screens and go directly to the title screen.
Having to watch them every time is a bit of a slog.

------------------------------

Playing Dinosaur Planet on Real N64 Hardware:

For Everdrive 64 you have to add "NDPE=5" to your save_db.txt file.
For ED64plus you have to force saving as flash.

This should make the game run properly on your flash cartridge.

------------------------------

Enable Memory Status for Crash Reports:

Crash reports are only helpful if you show us the Memory Status shortly before a crash happens.

Record the gameplay if you play on real hardware.

Or provide a savestate shortly before the crash if you play on emulator.

Memory Status is OFF by default.

Press D-Pad Right to open the Dinomod menu.
Scroll down to "Debugging".

Select "Enable debug prints".
Select "Enable memory status".

We need this info to detect and fix memory leaks. Most people forget to turn it on.
Keep this in mind when reporting crashes.

------------------------------

The people working on this Dinosaur Planet Restoration Project:

- MusicalProgrammer debugs the game and fixes crashes.

- Jeebs2kx fixes broken puzzles and story progression.

- Banjeoin fixes up the models and figures out the level format.

- Ren Fuchsfein compiles everything into the rom, adds minor fixes and helps with testing.

We used Dinomod v2.4 as our base rom.
Dinomod was developed by nuggs#1832 for the Dinosaur Planet Finder's Club on Discord.
Its original intention was to be a helpful tool for testing and debugging the game.

When it seemed like nuggs was no longer actively developing Dinomod we decided to start updating it.
It turned into a bugfixing project to make Dinosaur Planet more stable and enjoyable.

We can't do magic, but the original rom was in a sorry state and we try our best to make it more playable.
Perhaps some day a full Decompilation of the game will allow more extensive restoration efforts.
