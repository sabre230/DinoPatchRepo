Yay, I think I found a fix for that funny climbing-the-air glitch with that pushblock! 
It needs testing since it might still do it from some angles... 
but it seems to be consistently working when pushing directly towards the cliff from its original startpoint like most players will do: 

32821B5: 58
32821B7: 4F
3282395: 58
3282397: 4F
32823A2: 0E
32823A3: 84

The fix pushes the climb startpoint slightly away from the cliff-face, and I changed a "do-not-pass" 
line at the top of the cliff to a "ledge-grab/jump" line just so Sabre can move past there after the change I made.





Oh, there are two more glitched vines in that same area! 
Here's a fix for those too - 
the ones at either end of the pier outside CC Courtyard:


0x32850CA: 80

0x3285146: 80
