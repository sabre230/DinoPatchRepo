WM GENERAL SCALES GALLEON ESCAPE FIX:

The trigger object first needs to be moved closer to the entrance, as objects tend to want to reload in that spot for some reason:
0x211A6B2 >> 4469E430 4344E0A1 435E2F80

Now this:
0x3A73D36 >> FFFF
0x3A73DC6 >> FFFF
0x3A712AA >> FFFF
0x3A7078A >> FFFF
What's happening here is that when you trigger Randorn's intro cutscene (00D0), the galleon wants to unload itself. So I simply changed it so it acts as if you never triggered that cutscene. Not sure what the side effects will be.

A secondary Dockpoint is needed as upon return the logs position will be different. This may be remedied by moving the cutscene log elsewhere, not sure. For now I had to change one of the nearby "smallcrate" objects to a working secondary Dockpoint -

Oh and an unexpected bonus - mounting the log from this specific dockpoint will automatically trigger the flag to open the gates to BWC, so this code will no longer be needed now 02133502 FFFF


Just spotted a bug with WM 3. While everything set the way it is will work warping to WM, however going through normally - Test of Fear, then WM3 sets a trigger too early and makes you unable to deposit the spirit. This trigger is meant to set in the spirit chamber itself. Bit weird why they'd program it like that but this should stop that particular trigger from happening - 

03A225A2 FFFF

Dinopatch:
03A1BE32


Just tested going through MMP, ToF then WM3 and seems to be working now





WM2 - "Get that hidden!" cutscene oddly didn't play for me. Might be a chance I missed a flag but if it happens for anyone else, could use this : 

02116E1E FFFF






To check - does setting the warp activator with Sabre's side of WM keep the teleporter active on all his visits? If so this code will no longer be needed -

0211742C 08A1 - Added flag to activate WM teleporter"





02144872: C4C00000 Should fix the mine loading issue in DIM.





Small one. When going to Boss Klanadack from Walled City you'll be stuck behind the door. I've moved the nearby Warp point coords just a touch so you'll start just in front of the door now!

Item names Fix:

01FEDC90 57 - Adds the missing "W" in WHITE MUSHROOM
01FEDC8F 20 - The important one, adds a space rather than a gap. noticed there were 2 in a row





Fixed the map blocks to Dragon Rock:

0217B926: 8787 - For Willow Grove to Dragon Rock
020E14F8 6767 - For Dragon Rock to Willow Grove
020E17B8 6767 - For some reason, this spot is identical to above in hex, but both are required


Now hopefully I did this right... Copy everything inside this file, and do CTRL+B on address: 0x02CCBE42 in the ROM file, and it will get rid of a slight artifact in Willow Grove.

And speaking of DIM... Too many people Enable Cheats there, and it screws up Tricky's prison cell. So maybe one of the cheats should be disabled. (The Tricky Spawning one)

Here's the patch:
038E2194: 00000000

And to clarify, it is the culprit. The cheat sets 805C4C80 to 1 (Also known as: flag 04E5), which glitches DIM. Tricky would spawn when the game requested that Tricky be missing.

TriggerPlanes save the day again! Kyte would crash the game under the right circumstances if she didn't follow you into the Temple, which it appears she never does. With a TriggerPlane command, it can tell Kyte to enter the temple.

Address: Value
218D52E: 051C005D

She struggles to get out of the temple still, so if you want to have a go trying to patch it, I'd use something like: 0A1C005C for a TriggerPlane outside the temple. But I've been having trouble with it, so I may look at it tomorrow.



Alright, this patch will likely make the mushroom cave in Swapstone Hollow more stable. Added a TriggerPlane command to unload some objects at the surface.

Diamond Bay Cave Waterbaddie Infinite Respawn Fix
021721E6 0048




With this patch, Kyte now exits the temple, and I realized Kyte already had an enter temple TriggerPlane, 
but it's loaded way too close to the exit, so it never triggers unless the camera is inside the temple. 
So I moved that. Optionally you can unpatch the old patched TriggerPlane located even further back, 
but it's a good safeguard.

Move TriggerPlane further from exit:

0212C18E 00FF - WC Teleporter (Duster) Requires a flag to activate





Tricky sometimes causes Swapstone Hollow to crash. 
If you noticed, he doesn't always follow you out of the cave. 
This should fix that. 

Address: Value
02114E41: 01
02114E46: 00041413



I THINK this patches the Kyte crash in Cloudrunner Fortress. 
Blame the hidden doors in the treasure room. 
It checks for Kyte's distance there, without checking if Kyte exists first.

039F6328: 0C008E53E7A000281040007300000000



This should fix the crash in the Swapstone Hollow well stump. 

Address: Value
01E7B2B0: 7F




This should make the WC transporter only activate once 
both the Sun and Moon stones have been placed and the center has risen!

ROM:
0212C18E 0335





There seems to be some unremoved debug code that gives you a spellstone when you spawn in the Force Point Temples. 
This patch removes that, as it confuses the swapstone. 
At least on the volcano one.

Address: Value
03A36910: 00000000
03A8FEAC: 00000000









This ROM patch might make MMP more stable, 
if not, Discovery Falls will at least stop playing there.

020F92E6: 050300CE0A03000E


Another one, in the barrel sequence, 
I replaced an empty sound with an animation command to stop Krystal 
from... Spamming the footstep sound:

01EFC6B4: 0286000000000686





(THIS ONE NEEDS A CHECKSUM UPDATE)
An even better patch for the Galleon collisions. 
This time, the patch only effects the staff in the intro world. 
Nowhere else. 

00047FBC: 8FA5018484AF0046241800698F25005415F80006000000003C0F800B8DEF4A5015E0000200000000A0A0005A90AE005A03E0000800000000
000285AC: 0C011CEF00000000

Be sure to revert:
037EFD91 back to 0x10

Also, the checksum will need to be changed.




Another patch... It might stop the game from crashing when you're wandering the bottom of DFPT. 
Otherwise, at least Kyte won't be stuck on the first floor. 

Address: Value
0218D47A: 052601000A260100

All it does is despawn her as you're going down the elevator, and then she'll respawn when you approach a sideload object. 
(Which is basically right beside the elevator at the bottom floor, so she'll spawn on your way down)




DONT USE THESE - ONLY FOR TESTING - NOT FOR THE BUGFIX PATCH:


Force Kamerian Heart Death State:
0219425A: 0000 - Don't repeat
0219425C: 0095 - Force play
02194260: 01 - Kamerian Dragon death cutscene




Unfinished patch, 
just posting incase I forget later or someone can find a better one lol! 

CClogfix method 1 - 
there will be 2 logs, one DFlog and one BWlog, 
cutscene will work and you can ride the log that falls

ROM:
037E9B38 0022
037E9B30 0022

Method 2 - Technically works, 
but just the wrong way around!(BWlog just needs to be rotated)

02163D16 43D3

(DEPRECATED DONT USE)
(THIS ONE NEEDS A CHECKSUM UPDATE)
There are probably side effects, but the collisions for the objects on the ship work better 
when I set this address to zeroes: 

0002896C: 00000000

(DEPRECATED DONT USE)
(THIS ONE NEEDS A CHECKSUM UPDATE)
ALT, ALSO BROKEN:
The Galleon collision patch was flawed, it broke a pressure switch in DIM. 
(As in, you couldn't cast a spell on it) 

This one is better: 
0x037EFD91: 00

This only affects the staff object now.
