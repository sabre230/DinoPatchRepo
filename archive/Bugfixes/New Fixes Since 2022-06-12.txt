Small fix. During the freeing  Garunda Te cutscene it's supposed to show 
a short sequence of the mine door opening up, but this is hidden with a 
black screen. This will fix that and show the scene -

I made a mistake awhile back... 
03A36910 00000000 doesn't patch VFPT Spellstone flag...

Use this instead: 
03A87690 00000000




Also, this stops the save from getting corrupted when you place the 
spellstone there. The Swapstone might smarten up now.

Diamond Bay doesn't unload properly when you return from VFPT 
and arrive at Swapstone Hollow. this fixes that. 

If you wondered why you crashed near the entry of the Swapstone, 
that's why. 

Address Value:
02170D6C: 20
02170D56: 0A140000 0A14000A 0A14000B


To make the Swapstone entry even less likely to crash, 
this moves a TriggerPlane further back where the memory 
is lower.

There's some issues getting the VFP second state to 
stay loaded after Klanadack. I've changed one of the 
Triggerplanes on the VFP bridge to set this only once 
you have the second Spellstone (also had to move it a bit!). 
This particular Triggerplane only has a flagcheck in it so 
shouldn't affect anything, though any issues let me know. 

First section in the video is going through the first time 
(state 1) and second is with the Spellstone (state 2)

Also if you did manage to reach here with state 2 already active, 
nothing will add to the number, it will always force 2 as long as 
you're holding the 2nd Spellstone!

Making Queen Earthwalker disappear is a little harder than 
I wanted, but I'd say it's worth it. The more powerful 
TriggerPlanes become, the better.

0x4000 in a "checkFlagOnCollision" flag ID now gives a 
"trigger if flag not set" instruction for TriggerPlanes. 

Gives more control for the future too!

Another bug patched in DIM. (Vanilla bug, not mine) 
There was a bug that prevented the jetbike-to-conveyor 
cutscene from playing under a certain condition, like 
touching a TriggerPlane without a jetbike, and then 
going back with the jetbike.

This SHOULD increase the likelihood of you getting Tricky to Galadon successfully. 
Hopefully it works better than no patch. What I can tell thus far is it works if Tricky only vanishes 
on the pillars instead of crashing the whole game. Also, on the save state he vanished in, 
after I reloaded Tricky, he stopped vanishing.

02157132: 052601FF
0215718A: 052601FF
02157060: 24

All it does is reload tricky in two places. One at the start of the pillar jump room, (hopefully to prevent the crash) 
and the other in the lava room after that, if Tricky only vanishes.















There is an unused sequence that can squeeze into the "DIM2MammothWheel" object. 
SEQ: 02EE, then you can keep 0216F858 as is. (Value is 1 by default)
It's basically the same sequence as the used one, except both the mammoth and wheel are smaller.

Willow Grove finally has some life (even if just a little!). 
Fixed up and added the cutscene meeting the WGmutant to play in game editing the nearby null sequence object. 

Sizing of the mutant and belt object altered, audio patched back in for all lines, positioning, seq id etc added. 
Haven't figured how to keep the blackbars in yet, changing the sequence from "self" to detect the mutant takes this away

Also a new Transporter has been added that will take you to the Test of Magic 
(switching out the WGboulder and making alterations to work)

Noticed getting the VFP2 trigger is still a bit wonky. 
Have moved the Triggerplane the plane so should be easier to trigger. 
It's still not perfect as still has a chance of not triggering. 
Best bet is if you go past the VFP bridge and see a Sharpclaw, turn back and cross the bridge again. 
You'll know you're in the right state if you see 2 Scorpion Robots.

(For testing you can give yourself Spellstone 2 needed - 805C4DAC 0004)

An ideal solution would be if I can figure out how to change level states remotely rather than needing to be in the area. 
Lots of things later that would help with too.

Remove these from the previous code:

020EE476 4565
020EE478 ED98
020EE47A C4B0
020EE47C A000

Small one but was always bugging me lol. 
The small brown door in DFP normally has no trigger and will open 
when near allowing you to unintentionally get to the back section early. 
Added this trigger to only open once the block puzzle is completed

ROM:
0214E168 0766




WM 3 spirit release cutscene has a tendency to crash/freeze often 
(possibly an overload on the light effects). 
I removed the yellow beam from that cutscene which seems to make it more stable

ROM:

I noticed Klanadack's spellstone doesn't disappear 
when you place the spellstone. 

So here's the patch:
0383950E 063C





Shop Firefly Lantern for Sabre + Krystal and Translator (improved!)

You can now buy the Firefly Lantern!

This will replace the previous Translator codes 

Moved the Translator across the room (with fixes)
Set flags for both Sabre and Krystal to obtain firefly upon buying the Lantern - 
Currently you only have one use per character but will look at adding Firefly spots, 
or make fireflies unlimited!

Made Translator only viewable on Krystals side

ROM:
0218ED10 78 (Translator buy scene camera fix)
038171F8 0187 (SPsidefood large to Translator visual)

03AFC454 013D (Lantern flag fix Krystal)
03AFC450 05D6 (Lantern flag fix Sabre)





Quick one. 
After WM3, normally the game will allow you to do the Lightfoot Trials, 
which is too early. Rather than fiddling with the map setups I just changed 
the flag checkers to say only allow this to play once you've deposited the 
spirit after Walled City 2

Fix a Crash with a Pressure Switch in Earthwalker Temple map:
0217885E 000E






Quick optional patch, in Sabre's intro this will remove the puzzle solving sounds that play. On some emulators this will play twice (with the second being far louder it seems which is a bit jarring!). Removing this will not play the sound when opening that specific door yourself however

01EAB682 0000



This will stop this cutscene from looping once played in LVF. It didn't have a Seqtype number so would play infinitely lol. Adding one will make it play just once after the puzzle now

02134E2A 0003



Sun Temple Door Fix Improved:

Enabled and/or moved some of the magic gems and plants in DFP and VFP.
VFP 1 especially can be annoying to run out of magic for the lava platform section!
This should keep you going now

Magic plants moved/enabled - These 2 will be part of a big patch coming soon too

Just noticed the positioning of the BWC dockpoint has gone astray, meaning you wouldn't be able to dismount to get the Spellstone! 

This should put it back in the right spot
0217EEF6 C48D (previous code was C4BD)




Yeah most of the barrels have the same hit box radius which can be far too small to hit your target! 
Most of the time you need to hit pretty much dead on center for it to detect a hit. 
I won't post this in the patches channel as a proper fix would be ideal, 
but this will increase the hitboxes of all DFBarrels and CFBarrels essentially by 2. 

Just enough to still be able to pick them up comfortably - 

DFBarrel hitbox increase 
0380723A 0A00

CFBarrel hitbox increase 
037F669E 0A00


















OPTIONAL for bug finders:

Here's dinomod default memory status for real this time... 
Had terrible side effects like dinomod patches being off by default. 
I tested this one more thoroughly, and everything seems fine. 
The other patch will have to be reverted. 
As an added bonus, this one is togglable. 

038E5448: 0x24040039
038E5468: 0x1060FFF6
038E546C: 0x00000000
038E5414: 0x10000010

Turns on memory status by default, in the hopes people will keep 
it on and help me and others figure out where the memory leaks are.

Experimental Sun Block Puzzle Crash Fix:

Not sure, the same numbers in ROM look like they're here -  0005A9D4 and 0005A9E0. Though disabling those still come up with the same crash

They should disable the collision of those blocks.
