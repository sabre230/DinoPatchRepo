GOLDEN PLAINS TELEPORTER FIX

Golden Plains Transporter fix: To and from Test of Knowledge
Sorry had to upload to YT due to video size! Entering either of these transporters normally kicks you to the void due to wrong warp ID's assigned. To fix:

ROM
02109964 to 2A00
0216FC30 to 1F00

You'll need to force the game into a state of raising the shrine entrance and making the transporter interactable to return. To force this - 

RAM
5C4D72 to 80
5C4D73 to 01
5C5110 to 01



Gameshark code to remove the broken enemies in the shrine:
805C4D72 0080
805C4D73 0001
805C5110 0001








DIAMOND BAY SUBTITLES FIX

"Another Spellstone" subtitles fix - set 01F836BE to A20D






ENABLE WALLED CITY KING EARTHWALKER AFTER SPELLSTONE CUTSCENE

Finally got a ROM patch for this cutscene... Only tested on dinomod 2.4.0 so far.

212D2DA 083B (Spellstone Flag)
212D2E0 00 (Gate open sequence)
212CF48 083B (Spellstone Flag)
212CF4C 03 "Have you got it? Yeah!"
1F6C934 00 01 03 C6 (Fade in command)
38E0E2F 04 (Load under temple)






CAPE CLAW TEMPORARY LOG FIX

Looking into the Cape Claw Logstal thingy (post in discoveries discussion with more detail what I think is going on) Until that's properly done, I figured a quick fix to get your logstal-less journey going! . Enter 81252EE2 01EE, this will change the log into a DFDockPoint, making it ridable, and respawn should you lose it! Shouldn't affect progression. Long term fix should be on the horizon. Also can use in ROM 02163D06 to 0026 for same effect
Edit - If annoyed by the vast void of Cape Claw, enter 805C4F39 00FF to load all map chunks at once 







WALLED CITY DOORS FIX

Small one that was annoying me more than anything lol. Opening both pairs of doors in Walled City! Looks like the flag on one of the door halves are not set, so the opening sequence doesn't normally play in game. You can set this by:

Moon side doors - 
0212D4D6 from FFFF to 0814 and 0212D4D8 from FFFF to 0816, both in ROM
Opening flag in RAM 5C4D7F to 08 to open

Sun side: Set 0212D52E from FFFF to 0815 and 0212D530 from FFFF to 0817
Opening flag in RAM 5C4D7F to 10 to open 





SPELLSTONE 2 VFPT FIX (DEPRECATED DON'T USE)

Spellstone 2 Placement is sure an easy patch... lol
All you do is set 0878 in 20EEC4A to FFFF. Though it won't make it progress to anything, but at least the cutscene would play. 
I'm not familiar with what exactly is supposed to happen next. Otherwise I'd give a better value than FFFF.

DARKICE MINES SPEEDER CUTSCENE FIX (DEPRECATED DON'T USE)

This small sequence normally never plays.
If you replace the bytes starting at 37E9E20 to "FFFE000000009100030F00000000D000007200000000D0000000" It will play almost as intended.
I think the door is supposed to open, but I'm not sure.
The only reason it doesn't play without the patch is because it can't find the door.

FFFE000000009100030F00000000D000007200000000D0000000

0x1a bytes







WALLED CITY TELEPORTER FIX

Definitely! Speaking of warping stuff, had a go at adding the missing transporter in Walled City while changing the co-ordinates to warp you at the Test. Not perfect yet but seems to work fine in game. Might be a bit of fun adding others back in like Cape Claw to it's Test/Krazoa Palace etc!

EDIT - Values used for this - in ROM (change nearby duster to correct Transporter)
212C16E 00EC

Note to self to finalise later. Temp Walled City Moon pressure pad fix -   ROM 0212D3CA to 0000






GOLDEN PLAINS SHRINE FIX

Taking a look at how the internal warping works, looking at the GPshrine I found out why it kicks you to Diamond Bay when you get close! There's a WM_Warpoint object in the middle of the shrine room that's warp co-ordinates are somehow set to 42, which is for Diamond Bay internally! Changing this to FF will allow you in the room to do the test as normal. The "win" cutscene loops but should be a way to implement a new warpoint after the cutscene ends to take you to Warlock mountain, can take a look sometime. values look like this

RAM:
812536E8 0000 - Change GPshrine baddies into Dummy

ROM:

ROCKY TEACHES DISTRACT SUBTITLE FIX

Looks to be pretty straightforward adding missing subtitles back in game. Most if not all lines are there, but a lot seemingly just didn't change their appropriate values correctly! For this one you can edit 01EF780A in ROM and change the 8000 value to A21C. Would love to go and re add everything back in as it should be, maybe a patch down the line!

LIGHTFOOT VILLAGE LOG FIX

ROM:
021335A6 451F
021335AA 42D2
021335AE 451E
You can mess around to get it where you want to be!

DFPT SPELLSTONE FIX (DEPRECATED DON'T USE)

How to deposit DFPT spellstone after entering Golden Plains! - Quick fix edition
Normally entering GP value 5C4DA8 goes up to 10, then completing DFPT 1 pushes this to 96, around 7 - 10 higher than needed to drop the Spellstone. Something in GP_levelcontrol may be triggering this. To get this below 90 but still high enough to drop the stone, I changed the flag for when the RoboScorpions first spawn and defeated in DFPTB -  this normally goes from 10, quickly to 18, then 14. Changing the flag to 05F3 (same as entering Golden Plains funny enough!) it will now go from 10, to 08, then 0C. Now completing all the puzzles you should have 8E instead of 96, enough to still drop the spellstone! Might need some more tests but only downside I can see is the RoboScorpions will spawn slightly early, and again after dropping the stone, a fair trade off! Will update if I figure a better way. 

ROM:
0214D3A2 05F3 








TEST OF CHARACTER FIX

Test of Character Fix:
Value 5C5128 in hex starts at 00 before starting this test. Normally, when the Fox baddie spawns it will jump to 01. Then after the 5th hit, it will go to 05 (increment of 4) which is flag 0391. the game needs +8 to defeat him, or flag 05B2. Possibly an error during development!
This ROM code will patch this back in!

ROM:

DFPT SPELLSTONE FIX

Fix Golden Plains Bonfire + Better DFPT Spellstone Method!

This will change the flag causing that issue giving you the +10 when entering GP. This has been switched to bonfire spawn. That itself had some issues which have fixed along with the ChimneySwipe monster timing issues. Should be good to go now! 
Also you now don't need to use the previous code I had to drop the DFPT spellstone as that flag has been moved now, just play normally and you should be fine!

ROM:
03A57A5A 0917 (GP start flag to Bonfire spawn. Doubles as DFPT fix!)
03ADC872 07D5 (Bonfire flag fixed - gave out incorrect value)

MOON SEEDS FIX (DEPRECATED DON'T USE)

Here it is! I'll paste what I said in the other channel - 
"Getting the game to give you a Moonseed needs a flag change - there are 4 planting spots with vines from what I see = 4 flags to give you a Moonseed + the initial Krazoa GP flag. I thought that was too risky until I figure out exactly what these flags do, so the compromise is only getting one Moonseed to plant the inital one in MMP, setting it at the first mound, then once this is lit the rest of the planting spots will already have the seeds in them, ready to light. I have made it that you need to do it in this order so folk can't just skip or moonjump for the seeds to show!"

One thing worth noting is I'm not sure what the original flag for the GP Krazoa actually does - 5C4D71 8. May not affect anything at all later, but thought to point it out. If someone does notice anything at all different (from MMP and after only) let me know and can change it!

WM GALLEON CUTSCENE FIX (CAUSES INSTABILITY DONT USE)

I don't know why I bothered, but I fixed the cutscene where Scales escapes with Kyte. Also, you can get it to render properly without patches if you walk really slow to the trigger. 
The trigger object first needs to be moved closer to the entrance, as objects tend to want to reload in that spot for some reason.
I set them to this... 0x211A6B2 >> 4469E430 4344E0A1 435E2F80
The other patches depend on which patch you use... I'll just use dinomod 2.4, as that's the best one.
0x3A73D36 >> FFFF
0x3A73DC6 >> FFFF
0x3A712AA >> FFFF
0x3A7078A >> FFFF
What's happening here is that when you trigger randorn's intro cutscene (00D0), the galleon wants to unload itself. So I simply changed it so it acts as if you never triggered that cutscene. Not sure what the side effects will be.

UNUSED MUSIC THEME IN SWAPSTONE HOLLOW (DONT USE)

Well that's interesting... The game can't seem to access it normally
If I go to 01E6ABED in ROM and replace 0x32 with 0x69, then I can hear it in game. 
Replaces Swapstone Hollow's theme






ZOOMED CAMERA CODE ROM PATCH (DONT USE)

DIM2 PUZZLEPAD PARTIAL FIX (DEPRECATED DON'T USE)

This will stop crashing standing on the pad, however the downside is if standing on switch for more than a few seconds you will sink thorugh the button (similar to DFPT multi switch pad!) 
You can walk out the room and back in again to reset position luckily. Also this seems to just be a character only issue as shooting the rock on the switch works perfectly

TEST OF FEAR SHRINE GUARDCLAW NO LONGER BLOCKS THE WAY

0216D8C6 0281 turn ToF Guardclaw into SCGuarclaw
0216D8DE 02B9
Setting flag 02B9 will stop him. Could use this by setting it trigger when something is done, like collecting a certain item or passing a certain event 









VFPT SPELLSTONE 1 FIX (DEPRECATED DON'T USE)

I guess you could say that. Though this is the real reason. 
VFP_SpellPlace 054E 09 FE 04 E4 3F 29 (-14656.269, -1216.570, -1394.754) - [020EF45E]

  setFlag: 0877
  itemRequired: 0123
  in_setup(s): 0

If you set 020EF47E to 022B it should work in a more legit way. And setting 01F23ACA also to 022B (so that it gets removed from the inventory)

SABRE SMALL FOODBAG STORE FIX (DEPRECATED DON'T USE BREAKS SHOPKEEPER)

CAPE CLAW SHRINE FIX

Righto think I'm nearly done with the Cape Claw shrine transporter - had to use the nearby duster for now (sorry dude!). Everything lined up and works a charm! Last thing, which is just as important as placing the object I'd say, making it only activate when a certain flag is reached. This would stop folks just being able to jump in on CC first visit. Could be a headache or straightforward to do this, we'll see lol
Jeebs2kx — heute um 13:30 Uhr

Right this should do the trick for the time being. Made the transporter only activate only once the first Krazoa Tablet is collected (will update this to something more accurate when I get round to checking CC2 stuff)

ROM:
02163976 00EC
02163996 023B
02163990 2900
0216397E 452A
02163982 C343
02163986 4471

Not part of the code but you can test this in game either by giving yourself the tablet with a GS code, or 020F80A8 0187 - This makes it when you enter Cape Claw, going from BWC to DF will trigger the Hightop Scene.
Also just incase any of this get's lost in the chat not to worry, I'll make a video with everything soon!

QUEEN EARTHWALKER WHITE MUSHROOM PARTIAL FIX (DEPRECATED DON'T USE)

Not really a full "fix" per se, more just a work in progress thing! Looking at SH Queen Earthwalker stuff with the mushrooms. If I can figure out how the counter works it should be quite easy to fix the "10 white mushrooms" she needs instead of 1. For now I have made only 1 specific white mushroom actually count as feeding her (you can find out which one while playing :P), while the other 9 by default plays her eating cutscene and takes however mushrooms you're holding at the time away. I'll move on to something else for now, but here's the code for this -

the waterbaddie also spawns there now, it was not previously due to being stuck in some respawn loop which caused the sound and the crash in non dino mod near the traps






DISCOVERY FALLS WALL SABRE SPIRIT RELEASE FIX (NOT NEEDED DON'T USE)

What a bizarre thing to do. I can confirm that you are unable to unload one of the spirits as Fox later in a normal playthrough where you blew up this wall earlier.

Can I set 02119A6F --> FFFF here to prevent the wall blowing up from setting this flag? Or is it more complicated?

0212B37C 0080
(In combination with loading Walled city code which was 0212B36E 0F22 , 0212B370 0005) 


MOON MOUNTAIN PASS SHRINE GUARD FIX

but 0216D8EE 0000 this should make the MMP shrine gaurd claw not a solid object for instance which is probably a reasonable compromise


GETTING CLOUDRUNNER FORTRESS KEY FIX

Apparently removing a flag setting function in the Swapstone code fixes the flag to get the key for cloudrunner fortress. No more need to reload your save. 
In Dinomod 2.4, the rom address: 

3A422F0 gets set to 00 00 00 00.

Also, no side effects on the first swap from what I could see, as it's already set to the value the swapstone sets it to.




QUEEN CLOUDRUNNER 10 WHITE MUSHROOMS FULL FIX

This was easier than expected... 10 white mushrooms patched. (I think) 
This ROM patch uses dinomod 2.4. 
3A3DDC0 >> 24130009 - (Max counter, converts to 10 mushrooms.)
3A3DDD0 >> 01936822 - (if counter - max > 0)




VOLCANO FORCE POINT TEMPLE 2ND VISIT FULLY FIXED

This should allow you to enter and complete VFP's second visit. 
VFP Puzzle pad will normally crash on standing. 
There is a code to change this and allows you to use Tricky's "Guard Command" on the switch, but has like a 25% chance of crashing so left it out for now and made defeating the 3rd Scorpion drop the ladder instead

ROM:
RoboScorpion 1 working, positioned and flag fixed 
020EF1D6 C4C5
020EF1E2 04F2
020EF1F2 0019

RoboScorpion 2 working, positioned and flag changed (drop ladder instead of switch activation)
020F0A12 C498
020F0A1E 04F6
020F0A2E 0019

RoboScorpion entrance working, positioned and flag fixed
020EF19E C4A0
020EF1AA 04F1
020EF1BA 0019

Triggerflag on the top level doesn't load main room correctly after puzzle, switched loading value
020EF080 0008

Placing Spellstone gives you a Moonseed: (Next area in game would be MMP)
020EEC4A 086A

Moonseed flag triggers in MMP, planted state
03ADB916 0866
03ADB8E6 0866

WM WARP CRYSTAL MEMORY CORRUPTION AND SAVE FILE SIZE INCREASE

May as well talk of two new patches.

First, the first warp crystal in WM has the potential to corrupt memory when you obtain it, as it tries to write a value way out of range in memory, with the potential to write to game code.
This fixes that.

On ROM address, 03A7A418 set 3C0C0002 to 240CFFFF

All the flag is supposed to do normally is check whether you picked up the warp crystal in the past, to decide whether to play the obtaining item cutscene. The flag value is set to FFFF for now, which the game recognizes as a flag to ignore. (0x20000 was not lol)
If you see something like "TASK 240" in the save log, that was part of the corruption in action.

The other patch has to do with half-corrupt saves. It appears the game thinks the save data is smaller than it really is, so I increased the size of it. If you wondered why items would disappear from your inventory after you saved, this is why.
Here's the ROM patch:
03899342 14C4
