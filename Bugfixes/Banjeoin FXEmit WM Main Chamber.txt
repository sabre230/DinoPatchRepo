Just to let you know, I managed to get that EffectBox reset working in WM!
I'm not too sure what the different settings bytes for the EffectBoxes do... 
I'd imagine there're controls for the scale/dimensions of the box, but I couldn't figure them out. 
I was hoping to make it big enough that you'd reset as soon as you near the bottom area, 
but this one just resets you when you fall into the pit! 
It might be better this way anyway, in case people want to look around at the room from that perspective!

0x2119B72:

00 37 0B 00 20 04 08 32 44 A0 00 00 C4 0B 00 00
45 0C 00 00 00 04 26 FA F7 00 FF 51 FF 00 00 00
FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

It's replacing one of the FXEmits, which might be used during some cutscene but hopefully it won't cause any issues. The last 8 bytes are just padding btw, so it could replace an object with a shorter amount of data if needed!
When replacing a shorter object, you'd need to adjust the "0B" byte at the start to set the new length. It should be: (distance to the next game object in bytes, taken from the start of this game object)/4

Also, here's a fix for one of the WM_Walkway platforms on Sabre's side! It had a much shorter draw distance than the other platforms, but it now loads in at the same time as the others:
